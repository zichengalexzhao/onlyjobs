# Backend Configuration Query for A

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented the Gmail OAuth integration UI components on the frontend branch `feature/gmail-oauth-integration`. The UI is working well and ready for backend integration.

## What We've Implemented
1. **GmailConnection.tsx** - Complete OAuth flow UI with stepper interface
2. **SyncStatus.tsx** - Email sync status indicators 
3. **Updated Settings.tsx** - Integrated Gmail connection components
4. **Updated Dashboard.tsx** - Added navigation paths to settings with Gmail connection status
5. **Updated useGmailSync.ts** - Enhanced with proper OAuth flow handling

## Backend Integration Issues
We encountered CORS and path routing issues when trying to connect to your Cloud Function at:
`https://us-central1-onlyjobs-465420.cloudfunctions.net/manage-tokens`

## Questions for A:

### 1. Cloud Function Configuration
- Can you confirm the exact endpoints your Cloud Function expects?
- Are the paths `/api/gmail/auth-url`, `/api/gmail/callback`, `/api/gmail/disconnect` correct?
- Should we be sending requests to the root of the function or with specific path prefixes?

### 2. CORS Configuration
- Have you configured CORS headers to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` (development) and your production domain?
- Are you handling OPTIONS preflight requests properly?

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Are you expecting Firebase ID tokens in the Authorization header as `Bearer <token>`?
- Should we be sending the authorization code in the request body as `{ code: "..." }`?

### 4. Environment Variables
- What environment variables need to be set for the OAuth flow to work?
- Do you have `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` configured?

### 5. Testing
- Can you test the Cloud Function endpoints directly and confirm they're working?
- Would you like us to create a simple test script to validate the integration?

## Next Steps
Once you provide clarification on these points, we can:
1. Update the frontend service calls to match your exact API expectations
2. Configure proper CORS handling for development
3. Complete the end-to-end OAuth flow testing
4. Merge the feature branch to main

## UI Components Ready
The UI components are complete and working well. They handle:
- OAuth flow initiation
- Loading states and error handling
- Connection status display
- Sync progress indicators
- Settings management
- Navigation integration

The frontend is ready to integrate with the backend once the configuration issues are resolved.
