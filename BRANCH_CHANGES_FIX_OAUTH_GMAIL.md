# Changes in `fix-oauth-gmail` Branch

This file summarizes all major changes and new features introduced in the `fix-oauth-gmail` branch compared to `main`.

---

## 🚀 Major Features & Improvements

### 1. **Advanced Gmail OAuth Integration**
- Secure popup-based OAuth flow with Google
- Requests Gmail scopes (`readonly`, `labels`) and offline access
- Stores Gmail access token in local storage and sends it to backend

### 2. **Backend Token Management**
- After Gmail OAuth, the frontend sends both the Gmail access token and Firebase ID token to a backend Cloud Run service for secure storage and management
- New backend endpoints:
  - `GET /api/gmail/status` — Checks if Gmail is connected for the current user
  - `DELETE /api/gmail/disconnect` — Disconnects Gmail and cleans up tokens on backend

### 3. **Real-Time Gmail Connection Status**
- Frontend checks Gmail connection status by calling the backend, not just by checking local storage
- UI updates automatically on login, logout, connect, and disconnect

### 4. **Robust Disconnect Logic**
- Disconnecting Gmail now calls the backend to fully revoke access and remove tokens
- UI reflects true backend state after disconnect

### 5. **UI/UX Enhancements**
- Settings and Dashboard pages now show real-time Gmail connection status
- Gmail actions (connect/disconnect) are enabled/disabled based on backend state
- Improved error handling and user feedback for Gmail connection

### 6. **Supporting Files and Utilities**
- New/updated scripts, OAuth helpers, and test pages to support the new flow
