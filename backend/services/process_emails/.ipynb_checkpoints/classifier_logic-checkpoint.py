# backend/services/process_emails/classifier_logic.py
# Purpose: This is the core "intelligence" module.

# Functionality: It initializes the Vertex AI client and loads the Gemini 2.5 Flash model. It contains the is_job_application function (though main.py might bypass it if the primary check is in classify_email) and, most importantly, the classify_email function. This function takes raw email content, sends it to Gemini, and parses Gemini's response into structured job application details (Company, Job Title, Status, Location).

from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
import os # Added for config import

# Import configuration (assuming config.py is at the backend root)
# You might need to adjust sys.path if importing from parent directory in a complex setup.
# For Cloud Run, you'd typically pass these as environment variables or rely on Application Default Credentials.
# For simplicity, let's assume direct import for now, or use os.environ.get for env vars
# --- FIX APPLIED HERE ---
from config import PROJECT_ID, LOCATION # Corrected import to find config.py from project root

# Initialize Vertex AI â€” Gemini models must use a supported region like us-central1
vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION) # Use config variables
gemini_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-flash") # As per your code
